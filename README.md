# RandomStudentGenerator
The best random student generator ever. No doubt. 100%.

How to use the app? 
  1. Launch the app.
  2. Create a new list of students with the plus icon.
  3. Hit the done button when you finish entering the info.
  4. Now click the name of your list.
  5. To randomly generate a student, you can press the shuffle button and look at the top cell.
  
 The benefit of shuffling the list is that students can easily be skipped without getting repeats.
 The previous and next buttons move the blue marker, which can help you remember what student you left off on.
